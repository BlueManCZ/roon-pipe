## [1.0.14] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Network (TCP) API exposing the same command protocol as the Unix socket, guarded by a
  mandatory `ROONPIPE_TOKEN` shared secret.
- `now_playing` snapshot command.
- Tidal URL handling (`tidal://track/...`).
- `queue` command to read the active zone's play queue, and `play_from_queue` to start
  playback from a queue item.
- Pairing state is now reported explicitly. A watchdog explains an unpaired daemon on the
  console, distinguishing "no Roon Core found on the network" from "Core found, but the
  extension has not been enabled in Roon → Settings → Extensions".
- New `status` socket command returning the pairing state, discovered Core hosts and a
  human-readable explanation.

### Changed

- The Unix socket and network API listeners now start before Roon pairing instead of after.
  Commands that need a Core are rejected with an actionable reason rather than the daemon
  being unreachable, so `--cli` can explain an unauthorized extension.
- `--cli` checks daemon readiness before prompting and reports why it cannot search.

### Fixed

- A second daemon could be started while the first was waiting for authorization, because
  instance detection probed a socket that did not exist until pairing.
- The socket listener was torn down and rebuilt on every Core reconnection; it now binds once.
- `--cli` no longer reports "No results found" when the search request itself failed.
